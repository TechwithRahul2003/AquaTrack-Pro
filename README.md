🌊 AquaTrack-Pro – Real-Time Hydrosonic TDS Monitoring System

📌 Project Overview
AquaTrack-Pro is a real-time, IoT-enabled water quality monitoring system designed to measure Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) and water depth using modern sensor technology.
It addresses the limitations of traditional manual sampling methods by providing continuous, remote, and accurate monitoring for industrial, agricultural, and environmental applications.

The system integrates:

TDS Sensor – Measures dissolved solids concentration in water.

Sonar Sensor – Measures water depth for calibration and accuracy.

NodeMCU Microcontroller – Central control and data processing.

LED Display & Buzzer – Real-time visual and audio alerts.

Blynk App – Remote data access, threshold control, and notifications.

🚀 Features
Real-time TDS Monitoring with instant data updates.

Water Depth Measurement using a sonar sensor for calibration.

Wi-Fi Connectivity via NodeMCU for seamless cloud integration.

Blynk Mobile App Dashboard for remote control and live data view.

Threshold Alerts via buzzer and push notifications.

Low-cost, Scalable, and Easy-to-Deploy system.

🛠️ Components Used
TDS Sensor Module

Ultrasonic/Sonar Sensor

NodeMCU ESP8266

LED Display

Buzzer

Power Adapter

Blynk IoT Platform

📊 Working Principle
TDS Sensor detects dissolved solids concentration in water.

Sonar Sensor measures water depth to improve TDS reading accuracy.

NodeMCU collects sensor data, processes it, and sends it to the Blynk cloud.

LED Display shows live TDS readings, while buzzer alerts when levels exceed safe limits.

Blynk App enables remote monitoring, threshold setting, and notifications.
